# 3d-designs
Hosting locations for ACUASI developed 3d models and designs.


The magnet mount desings were co designed by Bremner Nickish and Ethan Doran.
They use 3mm tapered heat set inserts for plastic as can be found on Mcmastercarr
The magnets I used are 45-50 lbs of lift weight (tested) countersunk Neodymium pot magnets that can be found on mcmastercar as "Encased Neodymium Magnets with Unthreaded Hole" however we sourced them from amazon and aliexpress. I can provide links or pictures as requested
